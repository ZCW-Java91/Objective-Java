# Objective: Java

A series of Java exercises, to pull some things together.

## What to Do

In each of the folders in the [`objective-java/src/main/java/rocks/zipcode`](./objective-java/src/main/java/rocks/zipcode) package there are `README.md` files that
describe what you need to implement.

Then, you should have a few **unit tests** to prove your code works.
Each class should have tests in their own test classes.

Unit Tests are proof you're starting to become a real coder, not just a _script hacker_.

The sections are:

- bankaccountlab
- formattingbookinfo
- jewelry-store
- personproperty
- productmanager

(did you know that ctrl-T is the Mac keyboard shortcut which swaps two letters?)
